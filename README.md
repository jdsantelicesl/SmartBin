# SmartBin
## Intro
Introducing SmartBin—an automated hardware solution that sorts trash automatically into the correct bins for compost, landfill, and recycling. Using a combination of a Servo Motor, Arduino Uno, custom-designed and 3D-printed funnels, and a computer vision YOLO-trained model, we’ve developed a system that makes waste sorting more accurate and efficient, reducing the need for manual labor.
## How does it work?
Just three simple steps. Throw your trash in the chute, SmartBin scans, and the pipe motor directs.
SmartBin uses a camera to capture images of waste as it’s placed into the system. These images are then processed using a YOLO model running on a Raspberry Pi, which is trained to identify whether an item is compostable, recyclable, or destined for the landfill. YOLO’s real-time image recognition helps classify items quickly and accurately.


## Conclusion
With SmartBin, we’re offering a practical and sustainable solution to a widespread issue, making waste management at large events simpler, more efficient, and compliant with regulations. Join us in working toward a cleaner tomorrow.
Thank you!
